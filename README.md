### What is it
My complete bash script to setup and run a Infinit cluster. I hope these scripts will contribute to making Infinit a great stateful solution for cluster enthousiasts.

### Why
I decided to share my scripts as **Chris Crone** from [Infinit](https://infinit.sh/)/Docker help me over 4 days via Slack. See the [highlights](/Chat%20Highlights%20of%20the%20week.md) of this conversation. I had to scrap and rebuild my Docker Swarm cluster at least 10 times to get it right.

So far, I tried Resilio Sync, Syncthing, GlusterFS, and even Dropbox Linux (yes, I was desperate). At the moment, Infinit seems to most promising and I bet on them. Please buzz me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_pascalandy) if you have another solution which is working for you.

@pascalandy I’m just browsing through your Github repo, i’m not sure i fully understand your scripts. Are they for different scenarios or are they the progress made after lots of trial and error?

[5:47]  
infinit-storage-f-from-chris_(was_incomplete).sh is this the one that you would suggest trying?

### What is next?
I think this will help all folk and cluster enthousiasts and the Infinit/Docker team to get a third eye on their [docs](https://infinit.sh/documentation/reference).
