### What is it
My complete bash script to setup and run a Infinit cluster. I hope these scripts will contribute to making Infinit a great stateful solution for cluster enthousiasts.

### Why
I decided to share my scripts as **Chris Crone** from [Infinit](https://infinit.sh/)/Docker help me over 4 days via Slack. I had to scrap and rebuild my dev cluster at least 10 times to get it right.

So far, I tried Resilio Sync, Syncthing, GlusterFS, and even Dropbox Linux. At this point Infinit seems to most promising and I bet on them. Please buzz me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_pascalandy) if you have another solution which is working for you.

### What is next?
I think this will help all folk and cluster enthousiasts and the Infinit/Docker team to get a third eye on their [docs](https://infinit.sh/documentation/reference).
